# SRT Utils
A collection of python/bash scripts which are useful for transcribing/translating audio.
All requirements for these scripts can be installed by running:
    ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

Additionally, for ```srt-splitaudio.py```, ffmpeg is required.

More information about each individual script can be viewed by running ```python3 <script> --help```

# Additional Note...
These are my personal scripts, and are not designed for any serious or professional use (yet?).
